# NLP-Method-Shuffle-Tester-
This is a validation framework for testing the order sensitivity of mainstream NLP methods. It runs NLP method analysis (ID-IDF, Sentiment Analysis etc.) on original, word shuffled, and sentence shuffled versions to see how well the method indicates a loss or alteration of order-sensitive semantic structure like narrative form.
